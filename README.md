### Description

You can ether scan for exploits one by one, or run through the whole list of 407. This will tell if CGI code was found and if you have access (i.e. Forbidden!). Even supports a simple form of OS and Server App. detection. This was ported from a couple of C scripts, which came from a well known hacking site. I posted this here in hopes of raising the security level of Admins. This DOES NOT exploit web pages, just tells if exploitable CGI scripts exist.

<P>

Please email me any bugs or updates, anyone might find or implement :)
